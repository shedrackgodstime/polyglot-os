# Simple Framebuffer Test - Working Solution

## Issue Summary
The kernel was hanging during physical memory allocator initialization, specifically in the bitmap initialization loop. This prevented us from reaching the console/shell functionality.

## Current Status
- ✅ Kernel boots successfully up to memory management
- ✅ Physical memory detection works
- ✅ Framebuffer is detected and accessible
- ❌ Hanging in bitmap allocator initialization
- ❌ Console/shell not reachable due to hang

## Working Solution
The framebuffer is accessible and we can draw to it. Here's what we've confirmed works:

### 1. Framebuffer Access
```rust
let fb_ptr = framebuffer.addr() as *mut u32;
let width = framebuffer.width() as usize;
let height = framebuffer.height() as usize;
let pitch = framebuffer.pitch() as usize / 4;

// This works - we can draw pixels
unsafe {
    for y in 0..height {
        for x in 0..width {
            let offset = y * pitch + x;
            *fb_ptr.add(offset) = 0x0000FF; // Blue pixel
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Memory Layout
- Framebuffer: 0xFD000000 (3MB)
- Resolution: 1280x800
- Total memory: 12GB
- Usable memory: 255MB

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Simplify Physical Allocator
Replace the complex bitmap allocator with a simple bump allocator:
```rust
static mut NEXT_FRAME: u64 = 0x200000; // Start at 2MB

pub fn alloc_frame() -> Option<PhysFrame> {
    unsafe {
        let frame = NEXT_FRAME;
        NEXT_FRAME += 4096;
        Some(PhysFrame::containing_address(PhysAddr::new(frame)))
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Skip Physical Allocator
Temporarily disable dynamic allocation and use static memory for console.

### Option 3: Debug Bitmap Issue
The bitmap allocator is hanging in the initialization loop. Possible causes:
- Memory access violation
- Infinite loop in bitmap iteration
- Stack overflow during large bitmap initialization

## Immediate Goal
Get the console working so you can see output in the QEMU window. The framebuffer is accessible, so we just need to:
1. Fix the memory allocator hang
2. Re-enable the console system
3. Get text rendering working

The foundation is solid - just need to resolve this one blocking issue!
