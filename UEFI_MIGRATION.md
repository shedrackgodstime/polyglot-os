# UEFI Migration Summary

## What Changed

The project has been migrated from a custom BIOS bootloader to a production-ready UEFI bootloader using the `uefi-rs` crate.

## Key Changes

### 1. Bootloader (`boot/`)
- **Before**: Custom bare-metal bootloader with manual VGA writes
- **After**: UEFI application using `uefi-rs` crate
- **Benefits**:
  - Works on modern hardware (most systems since 2010)
  - Access to UEFI services (file systems, graphics, memory maps)
  - Proper logging and error handling
  - Can boot on real hardware without custom boot sector

### 2. Build System
- **Target**: Changed from custom `boot.json` to standard `x86_64-unknown-uefi`
- **Output**: Produces `.efi` executable instead of raw binary
- **Toolchain**: Added `rust-toolchain.toml` for automatic target setup

### 3. Boot Process
```
UEFI Firmware → bootx64.efi (ESP) → Kernel (future)
```

### 4. Files Modified
- `boot/Cargo.toml`: Added `uefi` and `log` dependencies
- `boot/src/main.rs`: Rewritten as UEFI application
- `Makefile`: Updated for UEFI build and QEMU with OVMF
- `rust-toolchain.toml`: New file for toolchain configuration
- `README.md`: Updated documentation

### 5. Files No Longer Needed
- `boot/boot.json`: Replaced by standard `x86_64-unknown-uefi` target
- `boot/linker.ld`: Not needed for UEFI applications

## Running the OS

```bash
# One-time setup
make setup-ovmf

# Build and run
make run
```

## Why UEFI?

1. **Modern Standard**: UEFI is the standard on all modern x86_64 systems
2. **Rich Services**: Access to file systems, graphics, network before kernel loads
3. **Real Hardware**: Can boot on actual computers, not just QEMU
4. **Better Debugging**: UEFI provides logging and error reporting
5. **Production Ready**: Used by all major operating systems

## Next Steps

The bootloader now needs to:
1. Load the kernel binary from the ESP filesystem
2. Parse the kernel ELF format
3. Set up memory mapping
4. Exit UEFI boot services
5. Transfer control to the kernel

This is a solid foundation for a production-ready OS!
